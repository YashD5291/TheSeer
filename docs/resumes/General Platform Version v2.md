Machine Learning Engineer with 7+ years building AI systems that
actually ship to production. I've worked across foundation models, LLMs,
reinforcement learning, computer vision, and real-time inference. Recent
work includes LLM infrastructure at Labelbox, robotics AI at Covariant
where I helped build RFM-1, and distributed data systems at Rockset
before OpenAI acquired them. I work end-to-end, from training and RLHF
alignment to optimization and deployment on edge devices.

-   Built Model Foundry's LLM system for model-assisted labeling.
    Modified transformer encoders with extended self-attention to handle
    multimodal inputs. Cut manual labeling by 40% for clients like
    Genentech and P&G.

-   Fine-tuned 7B parameter models using LoRA, set up RLHF loops with
    human preference ranking. Got hallucination rates down by 40% in
    production.

-   Optimized inference with vLLM and TensorRT on A100 clusters.
    Sub-second responses for large exports, GDPR compliant.

-   Designed embedding pipelines with FAISS for the Catalog product. Cut
    data retrieval latency by 45% for CV datasets.

0cm + 0.00001cm0cm + 0.00001cm

-   Helped build RFM-1, an 8B parameter multimodal transformer for
    robotics. Worked on the attention mechanisms for fusing vision and
    action data. Reduced real-data dependency by 30% through synthetic
    trajectory generation.

-   Built RL models for robotic manipulation that hit 99.99% pick rates
    at 1,600 picks per hour. Deployed at Otto Group and Radial
    warehouses.

-   Implemented sensor fusion pipelines combining RGB, depth, and
    force/torque data. Used attention mechanisms to handle cluttered
    warehouse environments for KNAPP deployments.

-   Optimized edge inference in Rust with TensorRT quantization. Cut
    latency by 38% for real-time decisions at McKesson pharmaceutical
    facilities.

0cm + 0.00001cm0cm + 0.00001cm

-   Built real-time ETL pipelines with Kafka and Spark for the
    Aggregator-Leaf-Tailer architecture. Processed 650M+ events daily
    from MongoDB CDC and DynamoDB with sub-millisecond query latency.

-   Integrated FAISS vector search into the RocksDB-Cloud storage layer.
    This work on embeddings and similarity search is part of why OpenAI
    acquired Rockset in 2024.

-   Developed Query Lambdas with parameterized SQL endpoints for
    customers like JetBlue and Klarna. Hit 99% uptime at 20K QPS.

-   Built Python APIs for invoice automation handling 250K+ daily
    transactions. Integrated with AvidPay Network's 500K+ supplier
    ecosystem.

-   Optimized OCR processing with Redis caching and ML auto-coding.
    Reduced invoice-to-payment time by 25%.

-   Developed validation endpoints with PO matching for payment
    automation. The platform processes \$145B+ annually.
